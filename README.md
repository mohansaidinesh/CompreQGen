# Abstract


The Automatic Question Generator generates natural language, semantically accurate, and syntactically cohesive questions from text. It uses high-quality distractions and effective questions to create multiple-choice assessment questions. This system is useful for creating test papers and evaluating students' comprehension of subjects. Python programs can use a Natural Language Tool Kit, which introduces text processing libraries for tokenization, parsing, lemmatization, chunking, POS tagging, and stemming. Natural language processing techniques help understand language and spoken language by breaking down content into its components, interpreting meaning, choosing relevant actions, and presenting it in a user-friendly language.
